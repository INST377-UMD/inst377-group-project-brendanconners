## Hong Kong Severe Weather Project

### Description of Project
Hong Kong is a popular destination for tourists, and weather conditions,
especially during typhoon season, can significantly impact their
experience and safety. The importance of our product is to help travelers
who might not be very familiar with the area of Hong Kong to watch out for
any serious weather events.
Our proposed system would be a better way to look at current data across
multiple things that a common weather app won't tell you, including
earthquake / thunderstorm warnings, and other things that a typical
weather app neglects to show.
So, we intend to create a full stack solution to give travel agencies the ability to have a feature to warn potential travelers to the region of potential natural weather events.
